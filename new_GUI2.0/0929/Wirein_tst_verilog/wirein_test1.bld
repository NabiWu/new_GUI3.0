WARNING:NgdBuild - The value of SIM_DEVICE on instance 'okHI/core0/core0/r0' of
   type RAMB16BWER has been changed from 'SPARTAN3ADSP' to 'SPARTAN6' to correct
   post-ngdbuild and timing simulation for this primitive.  In order for
   functional simulation to be correct, the value of SIM_DEVICE should be
   changed in this same manner in the source netlist or constraint file.
