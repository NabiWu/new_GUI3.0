WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net X2/WE_X0 is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal
   <okHI/core0/core0/a0/cb0/BU2/U0/grf.rf/mem/gdm.dm/Mram_RAM2_RAMD_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
